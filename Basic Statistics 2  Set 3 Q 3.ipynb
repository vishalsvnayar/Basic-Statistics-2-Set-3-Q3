    "I.\tIf the 95% confidence interval for the average purchase of customers at a department store is $50 to $110, then $100 is a plausible value for the population mean at this level of confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans**:True, because confidence interval identifies the collection of values for the population which is consistent with the observed sample.\n",

    "II.\tIf the 95% confidence interval for the number of moviegoers who purchase concessions is 30% to 45%, this means that fewer than half of all moviegoers purchase concessions.\n",

    "**Ans**:False, because Cannot say that with absolute certainty with this information.\n",

    "III.\tThe 95% Confidence-Interval for μ only applies if the sample data are nearly normally distributed.\n",
